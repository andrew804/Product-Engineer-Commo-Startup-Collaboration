# Want a real startup app on your portfolio?

**I’m looking for student developers to help build a real startup app by developing specific features you can showcase in your portfolio.** I’m the technical founder of an early-stage startup preparing to raise pre-seed investment, and I’d love to involve students in building an early version.

You’ll get a clear feature to own — with a defined user process flow to guide you — and full autonomy to implement it within agreed tools and frameworks. You’ll receive full credit for your contribution in your portfolio, CV, and LinkedIn.

This is a great chance to work on something real that will be used by communities, and to add a strong project to your portfolio.

This starts as a collaboration (initially unpaid), but if the startup grows, there could be longer-term paid or equity opportunities.

Each feature is scoped to be manageable alongside studies, and you’ll gain:
* Experience working on a live product, not just coursework or hackathons
* Full credit and references for your contribution
* The chance to shape how the app is built, not just code to a spec

If this sounds interesting, DM me and I’ll share more about the app and the features you could be tackling.

Thanks,   
Andrew
