# Want a real startup app on your portfolio?

I’m looking for a **computer science student or recent graduate** to take a hands-on, lead role in building a real startup app you can proudly showcase in your portfolio.

I’m Andrew, the technical founder of Commo Communities, an early-stage startup preparing to raise pre-seed investment. Commo helps automate how real amateur community organisations — clubs, societies, and associations — are run.

---

### ⚙️ The Current Phase
Right now, I’m validating the product and need to move fast — so I’m building with a no-code/low-code prototype (Retool + MySQL). Soon, we’ll evolve toward a custom app using modern frameworks like **Next.js, SwiftUI, Kotlin**, and a backend in **Node.js, Python, or Swift**.

---

### 💪 What You’ll Do
You’ll help drive that transition — **influencing direction, owning key technical decisions, and shipping core features**. We’ll work side-by-side to design, build, and evolve the product and its technical foundation.

---

### 🧰 What You’ll Get
* Build something real and see it live in use
* Lead full-stack development alongside a founder
* Add a standout project to your **portfolio, CV, and LinkedIn**
* Gain genuine **startup experience and product ownership**

---

### 🌱 The Deal
This starts as an unpaid collaboration, with the potential to develop into a **paid role with equity** as we secure investment — and possibly a **founding partnership** for the right person.
